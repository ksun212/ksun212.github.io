  Welcome! This is the personal website of Ke Sun. Currently, I am a PHD student at Peking university. My research interests are mainly on programming languages and software engineering. Particularly, I am working on type systems for Python programming language.

  Apart from the research interests, I also have great interests on history and martial art (especially kendo).
